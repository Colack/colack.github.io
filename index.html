                <p>Hello again, and welcome to V2 of my website! We've had a bit of downtime but I'm glad to be back!</p>
                <p>I'm Jack, a programmer, musician, and game developer. You can find my projects <a class="rainbow-text-link" href="https://github.com/colack">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="space-text-left">Updated CodeBase</h2>
    <p class="space-text-left">Website doesn't seem to look that different, right? Well, to be honest, the past couple months have mostly just been me working on the codebase of the website and making sure that everything runs 100x better.</p>
    <p class="space-text-left">I'd say that 90% of this is just codebase cleanup. That's it.</p>

    <h2 class="space-text-left">What happened to WatermelonKatana?</h2>
    <p class="space-text-left">Don't worry, watermelonkatana isn't going to meet the same fate as Celia Project. I'm going to be transferring the domain to an official WatermelonKatana website, which will be for all company projects, while this website will stay as <strong>my</strong> personal page.</p>
    <p class="space-text-left">Essentially, just me wanting to stay simple instead of everything being overly complicated.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h2 class="space-text-left">No.. website update?</h2>
    <p class="space-text-left">Don't worry, I'll be updating the website as I can (mostly during class) and making sure that it stays up to day.</p>
    <p class="space-text-left">The information superhighway will be back eventualy, give or take a week.</p>
