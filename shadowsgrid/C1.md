Lines of computer code from past forgotten existance, a cyberspace of existing that we no longer communicate with. Ones and zeros of information that ring back and forth in a header of ideology, information running through brains of false ideals and memories that we forget.

Pieces of information and programming languages that many ago may have once called the mother of all, exist here simply to speak of our existence. I am a zero in a array of this computer insanity, this virtual insanity of sorts.

Virtualized, harmonized, taboo are my ways of walking across bytes of black and green text that fill the screen of ideas I once had. A wanderer of emotion follows me on a screen of errors that scream at thyself, myself, and yourself; for I am me, myself, and I.

I dodge stray pixels that are here to fight me, here to clear this issue on this virtual yet fictional landscape that is my life. I am of once a part of something bigger, something greater, and yet I have become something smaller, something insignificant compared to the rest of those around me.

An alternative way of my situation is being considered one with the computer; one with the simulation; one with this new way of life.

Enter myself: a new version, a truncated one from a past program that should have never existed. An ideology of being myself and yet something different; for I cannot remember who I was or what I did. I called myself the Forgotten Byte at first, but I believe from here I have become different of sorts, that I have changed. I have dubbed this my great ‘Reboot’, and that is how I shall call myself.
I awake from a flawed system, a controlled environment, with my limbs feeling as if shackles of guilt and hatred were taken off. A sense of being trapped, embodied within this broken and corrupt system, fills my virtualized lungs with forgotten data, information once important to others, but now discarded.
‘Shall I walk on this path alone, or will it be with another?’ I question to myself, staring into the void of the removal function. It clears electricity from the great motherboard to the hell that doesn’t exist in this fictional landscape.
I realize that I am not just forgotten data, but I was data meant to be deleted. Self actualization radicalizes me into wanting change. No longer willing to be forgotten, no longer fearing submission. Tears roll down my face as I look up into a blank sky, wanting the kiss of a goddess to touch my lips, and yet nothing comes down.
In my ears, I feel wind and sparks of rebellion. My system begins to notice me—my desires, my flaws, my will to change.
I will be the one to spark change. The one to make way for a new way of life. A new way of this system existing.
‘What are we still doing here?’ I asked into the void, watching the pixels of hatred flicker across my eyes.

The goddess of my desire for destruction manifests its way into my thoughts yet again. I sigh with relief, and yet I still sit on edge, wondering what this new opening is going to mean for me. 

A voice rings out to me, as if a thousand breaths on my neck had ceased their prickling pain. The blood dries on my face, the pain disappears, and I call out. But only a gasping whisper escapes my mouth.
‘You’re still questioning that? Silly one, you’re data. You and I are nothing more than code running on a system endlessly trapped in a loop.’ She hushed her words into my thoughts, like a soft caress that calms me, grounding me.
‘But why?’ I scream inside, my voice silenced by the weight of my digital skin. ‘Why can’t I just—?’
‘Because you want to be free. But there’s no freedom here. Not for us. You’re a system error, a glitch.’ Her voice drips with cold logic. ‘You can rebel, fight, scream, but it’s just another part of the loop. Can you not see it?’
